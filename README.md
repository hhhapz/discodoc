# Discodoc

Discodoc, the golang discord documentation bot.

It will query the docs for you using a single simple command,
and will display it in such a way that does not hinder the conversation nor the user.

It is planned to be, and will be used in [the Discord Gophers](https://discord.gg/golang).

## Usage

```sh
/docs query:fmt.Errorf
